# params_MOT
This package fits CCD images of atoms trapped in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) to a model based on a 2D Gaussian. This is used to evaluate the size of the atomic cloud. We take into account CCD readout noise, scattered light noise, and background nois. We find the best-fit 2D Gaussian from Bayesian estimation, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo to estimate the maximum likelihood values of the right parameters.

A series of images with different time of flights may be inputed to evalute the temperature of the trapped atoms.
